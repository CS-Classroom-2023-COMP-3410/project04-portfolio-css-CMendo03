# Design Choices

Building a responsive personal portfolio website was a fun and rewarding challenge. To make things easier, I used **Bootstrap** for the navigation bar, especially to set up the hamburger menu for smaller screens like it was mentioned in the instructions. On top of that, I customized fonts, colors, and hover effects to match my style and give the site a personal touch. Playing around with different CSS styles really helped me figure out how to make the portfolio feel unique and consistent, I did this by using the bookmark that we learned about in class.

## Challenges and Solutions

One of the biggest hurdles I ran into was getting the stylesheet to work the way I wanted. At first, the colors weren’t showing up properly. After some trial and error, I learned about using `!important` in CSS, and that fixed the issue. Organizing my styles was another thing I had to figure out. Setting up a separate stylesheet for custom styles really helped keep things clear and made it easier to make updates. Testing the site’s responsiveness in browser developer tools showed me areas where things weren’t aligned quite right, and I was able to tweak the spacing and layout to make everything look better.

## Key Learning Experiences

- **Responsiveness:** Using media queries and Bootstrap classes taught me how to make layouts work across different screen sizes. It was really satisfying to see everything adjust smoothly without awkward scrolling or weird spacing. When hovering over or clicking on pictures with the about me and the favorites section they also jump out.

- **Problem-Solving:** Figuring out why the colors weren’t working and learning about CSS specificity and `!important` was good. 

## Outcome and Improvements

The final site is fully responsive and looks good on mobile, tablet, and desktop. The navigation bar works perfectly, and I made sure to follow accessibility best practices, like adding alt text and making sure the contrast was readable.

I would like to in the future understand how to use things like Java in order to create more animations.
